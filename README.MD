# Introduction to NodeJs.


## What is NodeJs?

NodeJs is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. NodeJs uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. NodeJs' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

- NodeJs is a JavaScript runtime environment.
- NodeJs is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications.
- NodeJs uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
- NodeJs is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications.

## NodeJS Program Lifecycle

* The lifecycle of a Node.js program refers to the various stages and events that occur during the execution of a Node.js application. Understanding the program lifecycle can help you grasp the flow of execution and handle different events effectively. Here's an overview of the Node.js program lifecycle:The lifecycle of a Node.js program refers to the various stages and events that occur during the execution of a Node.js application. Understanding the program lifecycle can help you grasp the flow of execution and handle different events effectively. Here's an overview of the Node.js program lifecycle:

1 - Start: When you run a Node.js application, the program starts its execution. At this point, the Node.js runtime initializes the environment, sets up internal data structures, and prepares for the execution of your code.

2 - Event Loop: Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. The core of this model is the event loop. The event loop constantly checks for events and executes the associated callbacks when an event occurs. It allows Node.js to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking the execution of other tasks.

3 - Event-Driven Architecture: Node.js programs are built around events and callbacks. You define event handlers or callbacks that get executed when specific events occur. Common events include incoming HTTP requests, database queries, file system operations, timers, and more.

4 - Event Registration: To handle events, you register event handlers or listeners using appropriate methods provided by Node.js, depending on the type of event. For example, you can register an HTTP request listener using the http module, or listen to file system changes using the fs module.

5 - Asynchronous Operations: Node.js excels at handling asynchronous operations. When you perform I/O operations, such as reading from a file, making an HTTP request, or querying a database, you typically use asynchronous functions or methods that accept a callback or return a promise. This allows Node.js to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.

6 - Callback Execution: When an asynchronous operation completes, the associated callback is placed in the event queue. The event loop picks up these callbacks from the queue and executes them when the program reaches their turn in the event loop cycle.

7 -Timers: Node.js provides a timer module that allows you to schedule functions to be executed after a specific period or at regular intervals. You can use setTimeout to schedule a one-time execution or setInterval for repeated execution. Timer callbacks are also placed in the event queue and executed by the event loop.

8 - Error Handling: It's important to handle errors effectively in a Node.js program. Errors can occur during I/O operations, network requests, or any other asynchronous tasks. You can use try-catch blocks for synchronous code or handle errors in callbacks or promise chains for asynchronous code.

9 - Program Termination: A Node.js program terminates when there are no more tasks to execute and no pending event handlers or timers. However, you can also explicitly exit the program using the process.exit() method.


- Note: It's worth noting that the lifecycle of a Node.js program can be more complex when you introduce frameworks, libraries, and other modules. They may have their own lifecycle and events specific to their functionality. However, the basic concepts of the Node.js program lifecycle outlined above remain consistent.
